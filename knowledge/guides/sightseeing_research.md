# Sightseeing & Experience Curation Guidelines

Purpose: Support `sightseeing_researcher` agent in building a balanced activity pool.

## Principles
- Blend iconic sights, cultural experiences, food, neighborhoods, and serendipity.
- Avoid over-scheduling: keep daily active blocks to ~3 major anchors plus flexible inserts.
- Group by geography to minimize backtracking.
- Consider opening hours, typical peak times, and closure days.

## Categorization
Use tags: `culture`, `food`, `tech`, `neighborhood`, `viewpoint`, `nightlife`, `hidden_gem`.

## Data Points Per Activity
- Name + brief compelling description (<= 25 words)
- Category tags
- Typical dwell time (e.g., 45m, 2h)
- Booking/lead time (e.g., "reserve 2 weeks ahead" or "walk-in OK")
- Approx cost per person (if relevant)
- Best time of day (if meaningful)
- Nearby complementary spots (1â€“2)

## Output Structure
1. Summary (themes + patterns matching interests).
2. Clustered lists by neighborhood/zone.
3. Suggested must-do short list (with rationale).
4. Optional / overflow list.
