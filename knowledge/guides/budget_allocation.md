# Budget Allocation Heuristics

Purpose: Provide shared budget context all agents can use.

## Default Allocation (Adjust if inputs contradict)
- Flights: 35–45%
- Lodging: 30–40%
- Activities / Experiences: 10–20%
- Food: 15–25%
- Local Transit / Misc: 5–10%

## Guidance
- If trip length > 10 days, shift a few percent from flights to lodging & activities.
- For premium cabin interest: allow flights up to 55% only if lodging stays mid-tier.
- Always mention if any recommendation risks pushing total beyond remaining implied budget.

## Calculation Hints
Daily baseline (approx) = total_budget_usd / num_days.
Use this to flag overloaded days or expensive clusters.
