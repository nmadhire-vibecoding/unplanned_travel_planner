# Itinerary Planning Guidelines

Purpose: Support `itinerary_planner` agent in synthesizing research outputs into a coherent schedule.

## Core Principles
- Morning: anchor activity or neighborhood exploration.
- Midday: food + medium energy item.
- Afternoon: museum / experiential / flexible block.
- Evening: dining + optional cultural/night activity.
- Insert buffer windows; avoid >2 long transit hops per day.

## Balancing
- Alternate heavy walking vs lighter days.
- Distribute must-do items early but leave one headline experience mid-trip for anticipation.
- Reflect party size considerations (e.g., reservation feasibility).

## Budget & Feasibility
- Call out any day where stacked activities might exceed proportional daily budget share (total_budget_usd / num_days).
- Highlight pre-book requirements and deadlines.

## Output Structure
1. Overview & philosophy paragraph.
2. Day-by-day table/sections with: Morning / Midday / Afternoon / Evening / Notes.
3. Budget usage summary (qualitative if exact cost not known).
4. Contingency / weather swap suggestions.
