# Lodging Research Guidelines

Purpose: Support `hotel_researcher` agent with structured evaluation of accommodations.

## Selection Principles
- Mix of 2 budget tiers around chosen `budget_tier` (e.g., mid plus one value and one aspirational).
- Prioritize safety, transit accessibility, walkability, and neighborhood character.
- Include at most 7 options; cluster by neighborhood when helpful.

## Data Points Per Property
- Name, neighborhood, star/quality level
- Approx nightly rate (converted to trip currency)
- Total estimated cost for stay (rate * nights * rooms needed if party size large)
- Room type suggestion (if relevant for party size)
- Distance / transit time to 2â€“3 key interest areas
- Pros / cons (bullet list)
- Cancellation flexibility or booking note

## Budget Integration
- State median price vs total budget and percent allocation.
- Flag if combined with flights typical remaining budget would be tight.

## Output Structure
1. Overview of lodging landscape (price bands, notable areas).
2. Table (or structured list) of options.
3. Neighborhood comparison commentary.
4. Recommendations (primary + backup).
